# Turing Machine 2

This project is a turing machine interpreter.

### How To Use It

Simply run the program in the same folder as a text file containing your TM code. The TM must consist of a header and a body. The header is a line containing each symbol used, and the body contains instructions, aligned with the symbols in the header. Each instruction is of the form <symbol><L or R><new state number>. States are indexed from zero starting with the first line after the header.
